Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.
# Check-in 1
During our first meeting, we discussed ideas on what our project two could be.  We have yet to think about a finalized idea but we are currently considering a program that tracks and visualizes memory usage in a C/C++ program.  A finalized project idea will be made by Tuesday Evening, March 5th.
