Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

# Check-in 2


## Ideas
For our project, our program analysis will focus on memory usage where we keep track of memory usage by checking the variable types of a given source code. We will keep track of memory usage of different control flow which will allow the use to determine the range/maximum amount of memory used. This will allow the user to determine the amount of memory the program it can use.

## TA discussion
TBD

## Planned division of main responsibilities
TBD

## Summary of progress
We have decided that we will do the static analysis. However, we have not decided on whether we will do the dynamic analysis or do the visualization as part of our project. 

We are still deciding whether to target JavaScript, TypeScript, or Java.

We are also still deciding on the components of the program analysis project.

## Roadmap

By the end of this week
- We should be able to determine the target language
- We should be able to determine whether we will do a visualization or the dynamic analysis
- We should have a rough idea for the components of our program analysis project

By the end of next week(Check-in 3)
- We should be able to complete a mock-up for our project
- We should be able to complete our first user study
- We should be able to complete our design of the project, allowing group members to start implementation of their components

By the end of Check-in 4
- The implementation should be at a point where we should be able to analyze memory usage of simple control-flow
- We will start to plan out how to do the final user study(TBD)

By the end of Check-in 5
- Create a video(TBD)
- We should make final adjustments for our project(TBD)
- We should start to plan what to do, which depends on the state of the project at this point

# Check-in 1
During our first meeting, we discussed ideas on what our project two could be.  We have yet to think about a finalized idea but we are currently considering a program that tracks and visualizes memory usage in a C/C++ program.  A finalized project idea will be made by Tuesday Evening, March 5th.
