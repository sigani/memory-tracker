## How to setup project
1) download and install  [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
    - the readme will help you, but tldr is like unzip, put in a good place (e.g home directory), setup path variable to target the bin
2) if using intellij, it should be fine afterwards
3) otherwise, might need to run `mvn clean install` and then `mvn clean test` to ensure everything works
