## How to setup project
0) project is using version 21 of java (open sdk) and latest version of maven
1) download and install  [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
    - the readme will help you, but tldr is like unzip, put in a good place (e.g home directory), setup path variable to target the bin (unsure how this differs from mac, hopefully its similar)
2) if using intellij, it should be fine afterwards
    - otherwise, might need to run `mvn clean install` and then `mvn clean test` to ensure everything works
3) examples of how to use certain classes will probably be in the `test` folder
